Each directory here contains one faban driver to run some performance tests.

To run these, follow these steps:

1. Download faban from http://faban.org/

2. Untar faban into $HOME/faban

3. Start faban with $HOME/faban/master/bin/startup.sh

4. Connect to the faban web UI to check it is working (startup.sh will
print the URL to use).

5. cd to the desired driver directory (e.g. randomfiles)

6. Run "ant clean compile deploy"

7. You should now be able to run the benchmark from the faban web UI.

Refer to faban documentation for more help on how to use it:
http://faban.org/1.0/docs/index.html

Also check the README in the driver directory for driver-specific info.
